    <h1>Sonnet 141</h1>
    
    <P>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,<br></p>
    <P>For they in thee a thousand errors note;<br></p>
    <P>But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,<br></p>
    <P>Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;<br></p>
    <P>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,<br></p>
    <P>Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,<br></p>
    <P>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<br></p>
    <P>To any sensual feast with thee alone:<br></p>
    
<P>But my five wits nor my five senses can<br></p>
<P>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<br></p>
<P>Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,<br></p>
<P>Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:<br></p>
<P>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,<br></p><P>hy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:<br></p>
<P>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.<br></p>
