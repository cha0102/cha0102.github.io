        <h3 class = "headers">The Perfect Trip</h3>
       <p> This is the first website that I built. I only used html tags so the website looks really boring</p>
        
        <h3 class = "headers">Travel webpage</h3>
            
        <p> In this website I have used both html and css tags. I used html for the words of the website and css for the decoration (i.e background, text colours).
            I have also included some images to make it more interesting.</p>
        
        <h3 class = "headers">Desserts Recipe</h3>
        <p>
            In this website there are recipes for 3 desserts that I really like. I have made use of internal and external links in this website, so the users can go to different
            places on the internet. I have also used some tables to present some data.
        </p>


        <h3 class = "headers">Blog</h3>
        <p>

         This website has two entries of blogs that I created for one of the challenges on Khan Academy. They are about the stuff that that I did in Digital Media & Web Design during Semester 2.</p>

         <h3 class = "headers">Event Invite</h3>

<p>This website is a guy called Ricky's birthday invitation. I made use of borders, paddings and margins in this website to arrange the texts. </p>
