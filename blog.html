        <p>Something excited happened. I started to learn how to build a website in Digital Media and Web Design at school. I used Khan Academy for learning purposes like learning about Html and CSS and used a website called Github to host a website. </p>
        
        <p>The reason why I chose to do this project is because I find it really exciting to learn about web pages and stuff like that, since everyone uses internet on a daily basis, and because my uncle is like a big pro at technology and computers, and he knows how to build a website.</p>
        
        <p>So today I had learnt about html tags like paragraphs and headings, and I made a really crappy website on Khan Academy. </p>

        <h5>10th September 2020</h5>
        
        
        
        <p>I had put every websites that I had made into one homepage on <a href = "https://cha0102.github.io/">Github</a> (this is the link to my homepage). This homepage includes the projects of the Perfect Trip, Travel Webpage and Dessert recipes that I did on Khan Academy.</P>
        
        <p>I felt pretty good about my homepage, because it actually looks like a real webpage. It's got links within the table of contentn and a link to go back to "homepage". I think my homepage is my best project so far. :)</p>
